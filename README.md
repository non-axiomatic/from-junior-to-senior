# from-junior-to-senior

A collection of Python best practices, coding patterns, and working idioms.  
From how a beginner might write it ‚Äî  
to how a confident engineer would structure it.

## Mission

Not just ‚Äúlearning Python‚Äù,  
but curating a **practical, readable, professional codebase** ‚Äî  
like you‚Äôd write it for Google, or for yourself at 3AM üåô

## Philosophy

Each topic is structured from the basics to a production-level understanding.  
The goal is not just to solve problems, but to recognize patterns, avoid common mistakes, and write code that feels good to read.

You'll find:
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Annotated examples
- Practical exercises inspired by real-world use and interviews

## About This Project

This repository is built with the mindset of ‚Äúmentoring from within‚Äù.  
We grow by explaining, by refactoring, by documenting our thinking ‚Äî as if helping a teammate.

That teammate might just be your past self.
